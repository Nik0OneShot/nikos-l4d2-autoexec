video settings:

Aspect Ratio: Widescreen 16:9
Resolution: 3840 x 2160 (let the autoexec do this for you, you can't natively select 4k on borderless windowed for some reason. fullscreen works just fine, though.)
Display Mode: Windowed (No Border) (let the autoexec do its job)
Film Grain Amount: 0%
Anti-Aliasing Mode: 2X MSAA (on 4k, anti aliasing isn't not needed. it very well does its job, but you don't need too much, only use 2x msaa. if fxaa was available, i'd use that instead.)
Wait For Vertical Sync: Disabled
Shader Detail: Very High
Effect Detail: High
Model / Texture Detail: High
Multicore Rendering: Enabled (let the autoexec do it for you, it doesn't do anything by itself.)
